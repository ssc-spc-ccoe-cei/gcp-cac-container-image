# Guardrail #08 - Segment and Separate

Segment and separate information based on sensitivity of information.

## Mandatory Requirements

- [ ] Confirm that the department has a target network architecture with a high-level design or a diagram with appropriate segmentation between network security zones in alignment with ITSP.50.104, ITSP.80.022 and ITSG-38.
- [ ] Confirm that the department has documented a deployment guide for the cloud platform and associated services (the guide should capture the landing zone if applicable)
- [ ] Confirm that the cloud service providerâ€™s segmentation features are leveraged to provide segmentation of management, production, user acceptance testing (UAT), development (DEV) and testing (for example, the use of subscription, instances or other cloud provider constructs).

## Additional Considerations

- [ ] Leverage landing zones that include predefined, secured, multi-account support to allow automated onboarding of different workloads and teams.

## Policies

### Validation 01 - Target Network Architecture

Validate department's target network architecture has appropriate segmentation between security zones in alignment with GC guidance.

- [08_01-network-architecture-design.rego](../../policies/08-segment-and-separate/08_01-network-architecture-design.rego)

Target network architecture design/diagram to be uploaded/provided for review & approval.  Design should align with the following:
- [ITSP.50.104](https://www.cyber.gc.ca/en/guidance/itsp50104-guidance-defence-depth-cloud-based-services)
- [ITSP.80.022](https://www.cyber.gc.ca/en/guidance/baseline-security-requirements-network-security-zones-version-20-itsp80022)
- [ITSG-38](https://www.cyber.gc.ca/en/guidance/network-security-zoning-design-considerations-placement-services-within-zones-itsg-38)

**COMPLIANT** if document(s) uploaded to `guardrail-08` folder AND it has been reviewed and received approval. Approval is to be uploaded to `guardrail-08/validations` and filename must begin with *01_APPROVAL* (i.e. `01_APPROVAL_email.pdf`)

**PENDING** status if document(s) have been uploaded/provided but approval have not been given.

**NON-COMPLIANT** if document(s) have not been uploaded/provided.

### Validation 02 - Documented Deployment Guide for Cloud Platform & Associated Services

Validate department has deployment guide documented for GCP and associated services

- [08_02-deployment-guide.rego](../policies/08-segment-and-separate/08_02-deployment-guide.rego)

Deployment guide to be uploaded/provided for review & approval.

**COMPLIANT** if document(s) uploaded to `guardrail-08` folder AND it has been reviewed and received approval. Approval is to be uploaded to `guardrail-08/validations` and filename must begin with *02_APPROVAL* (i.e. `02_APPROVAL_email.pdf`)

**PENDING** status if document(s) have been uploaded/provided but approval have not been given.

**NON-COMPLIANT** if document(s) have not been uploaded/provided.

### Validation 03 - Ensure Use of Cloud Provider's Segmentation Features 

Validate GCP's segmentation features are leveraged to provide segmentation of management, production, UAT, DEV and testing environments.

*NOTE* this validation relies on the deployment guide in guardrail 08, validation 02.

- [08_03-provider-segmentation-features.rego](../policies/08-segment-and-separate/08_03-provider-segmentation-features.rego)

Ensure deployment guide is leveraging GCP's features to for project and environment segmentation.

**COMPLIANT** if document(s) uploaded to `guardrail-08` folder AND it has been reviewed and received approval. Approval is to be uploaded to `guardrail-08/validations` and filename must begin with *03_APPROVAL* (i.e. `03_APPROVAL_email.pdf`)

**PENDING** status if document(s) have been uploaded/provided but approval have not been given.

**NON-COMPLIANT** if document(s) have not been uploaded/provided.
