## Taggging
Currently solution involves tagging the projects with `PROJECT_PROFILE` and specifying an "overriding" value.  If this is expected to happen often and/or there are many projects that fall under project profile overrides, then for better scalability and organization, we recommend making use of the GCP Organization hierarchy. Grouping said projects into Folders by `PROJECT_PROFILE` value and enabling tag inheritance will help you find your projects quickly.
